Dragonfruit is a passion project that I'm developing with my close friend [nick.](https://github.com/nicholasheine)
  nick works on the website while I work on the backend (the scripts)
  We are hoping to release dragonfruit soon!
## H3X
H3X is a windows inspired roblox script that I previously worked on.
## Syntax
Syntax is a public bookmarklet that I stopped working on after I learned to mod gorilla tag.
